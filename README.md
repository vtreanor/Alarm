## A Desktop Alarm Clock for Windows 7
There is no native Alarm Clock provided with Windows 7. There is a program called Task Manager but this is a massive overkill 
if all you need is a quick and easy Alarm Clock. There is however a command line program called schtasks.exe which seems to 
be the powerhouse behind Task Manager. So this project uses schtasks.exe with a Visual Studio 2015 front end to produce a 
simple Desktop Alarm Clock.
