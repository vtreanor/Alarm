## A Desktop Alarm Clock for Windows 7
There is no native Alarm Clock provided with Windows 7. There is a program called Task Manager but this is a massive overkill 
if all you need is a quick and easy Alarm Clock. There is however a command line program called schtasks.exe which seems to 
be the powerhouse behind Task Manager. So this project uses schtasks.exe with a Visual Studio 2015 front end to produce a 
simple Desktop Alarm Clock.

The time and date inputs are preconfigured for 'now'. Adjust these and press set, wait for confirmation on the statusbar and exit the program. The OS will do the rest!
